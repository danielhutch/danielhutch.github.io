        Swisscom iO &mdash; Part of the branding team, UX input and design
        <!--
        The Swisscom Brand Center is an online brand management platform including identity principals, an asset library and community. My role in the team included design and UX. It was partly open to the public expressing the core principle of oneness that had framed the brand since the beginning.
