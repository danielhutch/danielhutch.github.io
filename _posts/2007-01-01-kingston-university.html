        Brief
    </h2>
    <p class="project-detail__body">
      In 2007 Kingston University required a website redesign to reflect users expectations and current technological advances. An in-house team at Kingston University needed to be able to manage the site internally.
    </p>

    <h2 class="project-detail__heading-bold">
        Approach
    </h2>

    <p class="project-detail__body">
     Working closely with my colleague and sole developer on the project
    <a class="project-detail__link" href="https://petegoodman.com/">
        Pete Goodman
    <a>
    my role included the following processes to deliver series of page templates and components that would be applied across the site: 
    <ul class="project-detail__unordered-list">
        <li class="project-detail__list-item">
            Competitor research and best practice
        </li>
        <li class="project-detail__list-item">
            Design direction
        </li>
        <li class="project-detail__list-item">
            Information architecture
        </li>
        <li class="project-detail__list-item">
            Student focus groups
        </li>
        <li class="project-detail__list-item">
            Page template and component design
        </li>
        <li class="project-detail__list-item">
            HTML, CSS and Javascript
        </li>
        <li class="project-detail__list-item">
            Handover document
        </li>
    </ul>

        Execution
    </h2>
    <p class="project-detail__body">
        After UX updates the website was simpler to navigate with content such as course materials, fees and accommodation easier to find. The updated look and feel tested well with students and delivered a positive and open outlook. The website was live until September 2014, but has since been replaced with a newer design.
